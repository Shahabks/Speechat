# Speechat
## Spoken Language assessment
It takes either real-time streams of speech or a recorded speech and extracts the prosody features, does features engineering, building dataset. The dataset is then plugged in the ML algorithms to predict intonations, prosody, stress, and structures of the spoken language.
By using an ASR engine, it scripts the speech and sends to a language model for some further analysis to measure the pragmatic and sentimental expressions as well as mechanical/structural patterns of the speech.
